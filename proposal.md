## Introduction:

Its high time to let go of traditional ways of banking. With technologies blooming every second of the day, its time we use the power of technology to make things happen on their own with less human intervention. We can now launch satellites that can reach distance that no human had imagined that ever exist. We can now say hi to pluto. We can now harvest crops over sea. We can now make machines perform medical procedures more fine and less error prone than humans.

## The proposed system:

We propose a system that helps us bank smart, spend smart and invest smart. We name our system Barbara, after the french singer (and there were no female names starting with Bar, as we planned to name close to Baroda). The major focus of our app is to assist the bank customer to manage is account as well as his usual life tied to banking. The app is typically a speech based personal assistant whose primary focus is on banking.
With the evolution of banking systems we can easily integrate with their banking operations exposed as secured API endpoints with REST protocol enables easy plug an play abilities to any of the custom appilcations and mobile apps by treating their underlyinig banking system as a whole robust platform. The following are the major features that are proposed to be incorporated in the system.The system can perform money transfers safe and secure just by seeking your voice as the password. No more hassle in typing passwords, un paid bills and dues, missed transfers from others.

User can perform usual banking operations with voice commands. You can get answers for questions like

- Barbara, did I send money to mom this month? Barbara, what is my credit card outstanding? Barbara, can you check I received a payment of $1000 last week?
- The system can handle your transactions for you, without you giving any inputs other than voice commands
- The app can also help you manage your monthly budget by reminding you to be efficient since the pay day. (That is what we need isn’t it!?)
- Help plan the month with spending budgets and limits.
- Reminders on paying credit card bills or any other bills or to transfer monthly payments like rent, etc.
- Assisting you to save your money(this is where the bank benefits) 1.The app can suggest you to invest the money you saved with the income you had, with a list of possible and best investment schemes that are available with the bank. This can be a toggle feature, because not all users are interested in knowing about investments they are not interested in. Hence this can be made available on demand by the user.
- Spending is as important as saving. What is the purpose of just getting paid, save it in some huge investment and live a less interesting life. 
    - This can be addressed by having a system that helps you know about the on going promotions, majorly by digging the promotional e-mails that you have received in your inbox. 
    - This is also an on-demand feature where the user can ask the system to show the promotions instantly or configure a scheduled reminder which will be popped when a critical promotion ends or end of month sale etc.

## Value Propositions
Smartest way to bank. User won’t feel that he is interacting with a machine. User can get things done in a more personalized and human way that he feels to interact with the system more. With the system being human friendly and good enough to adapt to the pattern of banking/purchasing habits. The value provided by the system is a friendly, less painful way of banking, where the user is being intimated to avail services provided by the bank, which suits his own way of living. The following are the derived value proportions.
    *Ask* - View and get informed about your account transactions just by asking and not more
    *Manage* - Manage your account smartly by just commanding the system, what to do, when to do and not how to do. Your voice is your password, no more typing and verifying user profile etc.
    *Save* - Save your money by investing in the best and appropriate plans that suit your interested, provided by the banks.
    *Spend* - Timely and personalized notifications on the offers that you have subscribes

## Revenue streams:

The system being an application close to the operations of bank it results in two form of revenues to the bank from two value propositions, viz., Spend and Save. Spend results in transactional revenue while the save part produces a service revenue for the investment purchase that are done in the bank, viz., property insurance, mortgage etc.
